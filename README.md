# DSA210 UFO Sightings-Weather Analysis
## Project Overview
Over the next few months, Iâ€™ll be diving deep into UFO sightings and weather data to uncover correlations between atmospheric conditions and how often unidentified flying objects are reported. My goal is to understand the conditions under which UFOs are most commonly identified and what factors might influence these sightings.
