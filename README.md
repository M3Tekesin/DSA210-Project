# UFO Sightings-Weather Analysis
## Project Overview
Over the next few months, Iâ€™ll be diving deep into UFO sightings and weather data to uncover correlations between atmospheric conditions and how often unidentified flying objects are reported. My goal is to understand the weather conditions under which UFOs are most commonly identified and what factors might influence these sightings.
## Motivation
I've always been skeptical about external life therefore, I want to understand the patterns of the UFO's so that may interesting or unwise analysis arise to be decided upon whether aliens act foreseeable meaning that they are fiction.
## Data Sources
I will collect ufo sightings data from kaggle and weather data from local weather forum.
* Weather Data : https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/va/arlington/KDCA/date/2011-3-14
* UFO Sightings Data : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/NUFORC/ufo-sightings
  

## Tools and Technologies
* Python: For data cleaning and statistical analysis
* Pandas: To manipulate and preprocess data
* Matplotlib and Seaborn: For creating visualizations (scatter plots, heatmaps, time series)
* Potential usage of web scraper (for creating manual data from weather sites)
